### Overview of the Code

This code represents the structure of a basic **To-Do Application** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#### HTML Structure:
1. **DOCTYPE and HTML Basics**: The document is an HTML5 document, as indicated by `<!DOCTYPE html>` and the `<html lang="en">` tag, ensuring it's displayed in English.
   
2. **Head Section**:
   - **Meta Tags**: Includes `charset="UTF-8"`, ensuring proper character encoding, and `viewport`, which makes the page responsive across different screen sizes.
   - **Font Linking**: It uses Google Fonts to load the "Poppins" font in two weights (400 and 600) for styling the text.
   - **Stylesheets and Scripts**:
     - A custom `style.css` file is linked for styling the page.
     - A JavaScript file, `script.js`, is linked with the `defer` attribute, meaning it will be executed after the HTML is parsed.
   
3. **Body Section**:
   - **Hero Section**: The page is enclosed within a `section` element with a class of `hero`. It contains:
     - A heading (`<h1>`) displaying "To-Do App".
     - A form with an input field (`<input>`) where users can type their tasks, and a button (`<button>`) to add the task to the list.
     - The form has the `id="form"`, and the input field has `id="todoInput"`.
   - **Todo List Display**: An unordered list (`<ul>`) with the `id="listGroup"` is used to display the tasks dynamically once added.
   
4. **Ionicons Script**: The code includes an external script from Ionicons, a popular icon library, which is used for adding icons to the application (though no specific icons are used in this code snippet).

#### Functionality (Implied by the Code):
- **Adding Tasks**: The user can input a task and click the "Add List" button to add it to the list. 
- **Dynamic Interaction**: The tasks will appear under the "To-Do App" heading in the form of a list (though the actual task-adding logic is likely implemented in the linked `script.js` file).
  
This is the basic HTML structure of the To-Do App, and the appearance and functionality will be defined by the external CSS and JavaScript files.
